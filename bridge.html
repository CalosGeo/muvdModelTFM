                  A structure that connects two locations and provides for the
                  passage of a transportation route (for example: a road or a
                  railway) over a terrain obstacle (for example: a waterbody, a

                  A bridge consists of a set of two abutments and/or zero or
                  more bridge piers joined by bridge spans. A bridge may serve,
                  for example, as an overpass or a viaduct. In the context of a
                  bridge, the scope of the term 'transportation route' includes
                  the transportation of liquids or gases by means of either
                  pipelines or aqueducts.

                      line right-of-way, a river, rapid, and/or a bridge). A
                      feature-specific rule may apply. In the case of a bridge,
                      the width is the distance perpendicular to the bridge

                      or use exists then (1) if the feature is irregular in
                      shape its width is taken perpendicular to the direction of
                      its greatest horizontal dimension (see Attribute:
                      'Greatest Horizontal Extent'), else (2) if the feature is
                      regular in shape then a shape-specific rule may apply: for
                      a rectangular feature, the length of the shorter axis; for
                      a round feature, the diameter.

                      highest elevation is that of the entire feature stack. For
                      example, the highest elevation of a church is that of its
                      steeple and not that of the roof of the church itself. The
