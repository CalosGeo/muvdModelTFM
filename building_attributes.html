                      The raw sugar is mixed with heavy syrup, centrifuged,
                      separated, dissolved, treated, filtered, concentrated to
                      supersaturation and then repeatedly crystallized under
                      vacuum to produce white refined sugar. To produce
                      granulated sugar in which the individual sugar grains do
                      not clump together, the refined sugar must be completely
                      dried. This is accomplished first by drying the sugar in a
                      hot rotary dryer, and then by conditioning the sugar by
                      blowing cool air through it for several days.

                      Wireless repeaters are used extensively (for example: in
                      dispatching, amateur radio, and emergency services
                      communications) to relay radio signals across a wider
                      area. With most emergency dispatching systems (for
                      example: police, fire brigade, ambulance, taxicab, tow
                      truck, and other services), the repeater is synonymous
                      with the base station, which performs both functions. A
                      duplex repeater uses two radio frequencies; an 'Input'
                      frequency, which it monitors for signals, and an 'Output'
                      frequency, on which it retransmits the received signals at
                      a higher power or higher altitude. Full-duplex repeators
                      are commonly used in radio and television broadcasting in
                      mountainous regions (termed 'broadcast translator' or
                      'broadcast repeator').
