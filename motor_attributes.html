                  <tr><td>biodiesel</td><td>16</td><td>A fuel made from vegetable oils (for example: soybean or canola), animal fats, and/or recycled grease, and intended for use in diesel engines.</td><td>For U.S. Energy Information Administration reporting, biodiesel is a fuel composed of mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats, and meeting the requirements of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6751. Biodiesel is registered with the EPA as both a fuel and a fuel additive. Its designation as B100 indicates it is unblended (100 percent) biodiesel. It can serve as a substitute for petroleum-derived diesel or distillate fuel. Biodiesel Blend is a fuel that combines pure biodiesel stock with petroleum-based diesel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>biodieselBlend</td><td>22</td><td>A fuel blended from biodiesel and petroleum-based diesel fuel, and intended for use in diesel engines.</td><td>Biodiesel Blend is designated BXX, where XX represents the volume percentage of biodiesel fuel in the blend. The blending ratio typically varies from 2 percent biodiesel (B2) up to 99.9 percent biodiesel (B99.9), with unblended biodiesel referred to as B100. Blending may occur at the point of biodiesel production, at an intermediate storage or distribution facility, or at the point-of-sale (for example: a motor vehicle station).</td></tr>
<tr><td>compressedNaturalGas</td><td>12</td><td>Natural gas compressed into high-pressure cylinders and used as an environmentally friendly fuel.</td><td>Natural gas occurs naturally underground, consisting chiefly of methane and is often found associated with petroleum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>dieselOil</td><td>5</td><td>A petroleum fraction used as fuel in diesel engines.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>ethanol85</td><td>17</td><td>A mixed biofuel consisting of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent unleaded gasoline, commonly known as 'E85'.</td><td>It can be used to run automobiles known as flexible fuel vehicles (FFV). Using E85 in non-FFV vehicles can cause corrosion of vehicle parts, because these parts are notá incompatible with high concentrations of ethanol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>hydrogen</td><td>18</td><td>A colorless odorless highly flammable diatomic gas that may be used as an alternative fuel for transportation.</td><td>Using a fuel cell, hydrogen may be used to generate electricity to power electrically-driven wheels, or it may be directly combusted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>hythane</td><td>19</td><td>Hythane (Hydrogen Compressed Natural Gas (HCNG)) is a mixture of natural gas (methane) and hydrogen.</td><td>Hythane is usually 5-7 percent hydrogen by energy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>kerosene</td><td>3</td><td>A petroleum distillate containing liquid hydrocarbons which boils in the range 150 to 300 degrees Centigrade.</td><td>It is used as a fuel for tractors and jet engines, and in domestic heaters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>liquefiedNaturalGas</td><td>20</td><td>Natural gas that has been liquefied for ease of transport by cooling the gas to -162 degrees Centigrade.</td><td>It is stored in a vacuum bottle-type container at very low temperatures and under moderate pressure. Natural gas has 600 times the volume of LNG.</td></tr>
<tr><td>liquefiedPetroleumGas</td><td>11</td><td>A mixture of propane and butane, usually with propylene and butylenes present in small concentration and a powerful odorant, ethyl mercaptan, added so that leaks can be detected easily.</td><td>It becomes liquid at room temperature at 6 bar pressure, so it is supplied in pressurised steel bottles. The liquefied gas has an expansion ratio of about 250:1. Used as a fuel in heating appliances and vehicles. LPG is manufactured during the refining of crude oil, or extracted from oil or gas streams as they emerge from the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>petrol</td><td>1</td><td>Refined petroleum as used as a fuel in motor vehicles.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>propane</td><td>21</td><td>A colorless gas, C3H8, derived from natural gas and petroleum and widely used as a fuel.</td><td>Commonly transported and dispensed in liquefied form, especially in pressurized hand-carry tanks for use as a fuel for outdoor cooking in barbecues and portable stoves. The standard steel container holds 18 litre (4.73 U.S. gallon) and is often termed a 'barbecue tank'. Due to its low boiling point, liquefied propane vaporizes as soon as it is released from its pressurized container. Note that Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) sold as an automotive fuel is a combination of propane and butane, often with propylene and/or butylenes, plus an odorant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Other</td><td>999</td><td>The attribute value is known, but is not currently a valid member of the attribute range.</td><td>The actual value may have been previously, or may become in the future, a valid member of the attribute range.</td></tr>
