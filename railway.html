                      line right-of-way, a river, rapid, and/or a bridge). A
                      feature-specific rule may apply. In the case of a bridge,
                      the width is the distance perpendicular to the bridge
                      centre-line and generally in the horizontal plane. In the
                      case of a dam, the width is the distance perpendicular to
                      (across the) the dam crest. If no such direction of flow
                      or use exists then (1) if the feature is irregular in
                      shape its width is taken perpendicular to the direction of
                      its greatest horizontal dimension (see Attribute:
                      'Greatest Horizontal Extent'), else (2) if the feature is
                      regular in shape then a shape-specific rule may apply: for
                      a rectangular feature, the length of the shorter axis; for
                      a round feature, the diameter.
